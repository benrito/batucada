    <em>Local, community-run events are a core part of the Drumbeat strategy.</em> These
    events invite teachers, artists, filmakers, bloggers, lawyers, web developers and 
    anyone else who cares about the internet to talk about building and protecting the 
    open web for the future, and using open technologies to build a better world.

    <em>Mozilla is looking for local leaders who want to organize a Drumbeat event in their 
    own city.</em> To learn more, check out the Drumbeat Local Events kit on our wiki here:

  <p>
    <em>The annual Mozilla Drumbeat Festival is a big crazy event</em> where 300 - 400 people gather 
    yearly to talk about how their personal passion (like education, media or science) 
    intersects with the open web. And make things. And have fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The 2010 Drumbeat Festival was focused on &quot;Learning, Freedom and the Web&quot;</em> 
    and brought together educators and hackers working to reinvent the future of learning. Their 
    work continues online at <a href="http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/">http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/</a>.
